ABLM - an A-B Loop Manager
==========================

ablm is a mpv script for managing A-B loops, with the following features:

- saving and restoring multiple A-B loops for every single video
- replaying and moving between any saved A-B loop

Usage
-----

Download and save the script file *ablm.lua* to mpv's script directory (should
be *~/.config/mpv/scripts* for linux), then you can interact with A-B loops in
mpv using the following keybinds:

- ``Alt-l``: save the current A-B loop
- ``Ctrl-l``: move to the next A-B loop
- ``Ctrl-L``: move to the previous A-B loop
